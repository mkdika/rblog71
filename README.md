Yet another simple Ruby on Rails (RoR) blog application.
This is my RoR full stack web development learning project & example, including its automatic CI/CD setup and cloud platform deployment.

### Note for rBlog 7.1

This is a newer version of my previously project [rBlog](https://github.com/mkdika/rblog). After 3 years working as RoR developer, and have been involving on several real production apps. This project is for me to put the so far delightfulness of working with RoR into a more simpler yet robust web application since then. Furthermore, to enjoy the mix of Ruby 3 & RoR 7 :)
